We've all heard it, only those striving to fail tread unknown waters and make no efforts to actually know more about the lay of the land before erecting their home. Is stock investing any different? Be a hero, get to know your stonks and gain the wealth you've only dreamt about!

## Solution Highlights  


1. XGBoost is an ensemble technqiue based on decision trees that leverages gradient boosting for fast speed and high performance.


2. In XGBoost, decision trees are added to correct the errors made by the previous trees until no further improvements can be made.


3. It uses gradient descent to minimise the loss when adding new models. It has in-built regularisation.


4. A max depth parameter is specified while designing XGBoost model. Once the tree reaches max depth,
it starts pruning upwards removing branches with no positive gain.


5. It takes advantage of hardware optimization to improve efficiency,reduce computational time and allocate optimal memory resources.

## A look at the code

The image that follows is a look at a snippet of the code behind the model.

The image below shows the accuracy with which our model fits the dataset we train it on. As can be seen, it fits almost perfectly.

## A look at the UI

Even though the backend is what makes a product work, what sells it is its presentation. In other words, the frontend.
